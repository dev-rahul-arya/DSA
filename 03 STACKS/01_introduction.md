# STACKS

- Linear data structure which follows LIFO - Last In First Out

## STACK ADT

In order to create a stack we need a pointer to the topmost element along with other elements which are stored inside the stack.

Operations:
- `push()`
- `pop()`
- `peek()`
- `isEmpty()` or `isFull()`

Stack can be implemented either via Array or Linked List.
